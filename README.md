# How To Play

Press START. A question will pop-up, and the timer will start. 

You will have 15 seconds to answer the question. Click on an answer to submit.

If you do not choose an answer in time, the timer will time out and will move on to the next questions.

You will neither lose nor gain points for time outs. 

If you choose the wrong answer, the right answer will be hilighted and a point will be added to the number wrong.

Once you are finished answering all questions, a screen will show displaying how many you got right and wrong.

You also have an option to play again! They will always be the same questions, so you can practice some trivia.
